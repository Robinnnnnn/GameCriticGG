# GameCriticgg

GameCritic is a site where any gamer can be a critic and review their favorite or least favorite video games. The idea came about while trying to explain to friends how even bad games have great features, for instance the sound design in game creates a deep feeling of being immersed in another world. I belive that feedback is crucial, both for game studios and for the teams that create the games. Getting feedback on specific attributes of the game can help emphasize exactly what went right, and what went wrong. That why at GameCritic you can rate games based on Art, Sound, and Mechanics. All reviews get averaged and a score GC score is generated.
